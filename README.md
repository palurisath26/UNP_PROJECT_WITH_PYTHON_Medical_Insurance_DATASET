# UNP_PROJECT_WITH_PYTHON_Medical_Insurance_DATASET


Completed this project as a part of my Python (Machine Learning) Internship with United Network of Professionals (UNP).

Overview- This project covers various foundational aspects of a machine learning project including data preprocessing, data visualization, prediction using multiple models. The best-performing model was chosen for deployment.

Topics Covered :

Exploring the Dataset
Converting Categorical Values to Numerical
Plotting Heatmap to See Dependency of Dependent Value on Independent Features
Data Visualization (Plots of Feature vs Feature)
Data Preparation
Prediction Using Machine Learning Algorithms (Classification)
Logistic Regression
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Plotting Graph for All Models to Compare Performance
Preparing Model for Deployment
Algorithms Comparison
